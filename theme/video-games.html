        <p>In video games, artificial intelligence is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent
            behaviors primarily in non-player characters similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial
            intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in the 1950s. The role of AI
            in video games has expanded greatly since its introduction. Modern games often implement existing
            techniques from the field of artificial intelligence such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the
            actions of NPCs. Additionally, AI is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the
            user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation.</p>

        <p>The term "game AI" is used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control
            theory, robotics, computer graphics and computer science in general, and so video game AI may often not
            constitute "true AI" in that such techniques do not necessarily facilitate computer learning or other
            standard criteria, only constituting "automated computation" or a predetermined and limited set of
            responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs.

            Many industry and corporate voices claim that so-called video game AI has come a long way in the
            sense that it has revolutionized the way humans interact with all forms of technology, although many
            expert researchers are skeptical of such claims, and particularly of the notion that such technologies fit
            the definition of "intelligence" standardly used in the cognitive sciences. Industry voices
            make the argument that AI has become more versatile in the way we use all technological devices for more
            than their intended purpose because the AI allows the technology to operate in multiple ways, allegedly
            developing their own personalities and carrying out complex instructions of the user.

            However, many in the field of AI have argued that video game AI is not true intelligence, but an
            advertising buzzword used to describe computer programs that use simple sorting and matching algorithms to
            create the illusion of intelligent behavior while bestowing software with a misleading aura of scientific
            or technological complexity and advancement. Since game AI for NPCs is centered on appearance of
            intelligence and good gameplay within environment restrictions, its approach is very different from that of
            traditional AI.</p>
