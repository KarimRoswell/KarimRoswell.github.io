        <p>Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to
            Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer.
            There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than
            800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer. This negatively affects the doctors, because there are too many
            options to choose from, making it more difficult to choose the right drugs for the patients. Microsoft is
            working on a project to develop a machine called "Hanover". Its goal is to memorize all the papers
            necessary to cancer and help predict which combinations of drugs will be most effective for each patient.
            One project that is being worked on at the moment is fighting myeloid leukemia, a fatal cancer where the
            treatment has not improved in decades. Another study was reported to have found that artificial
            intelligence was as good as trained doctors in identifying skin cancers. Another study is using
            artificial intelligence to try and monitor multiple high-risk patients, and this is done by asking each
            patient numerous questions based on data acquired from live doctor to patient interactions.</p>

        <p>In the field of mental health care, artificial intelligence can be used to improve the diagnosis efficiency
            and helpfulness with patients. A study done in 2012 showed the use of an classification model that was
            built to shorten the 91-part Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised that is used to identify autism
            disorder through behavior. Through their analysis of the data from the Autism Genomic Resource
            Exchange, they were able to build a decision tree classifier that contained only 7 questions, and
            was able to identify autism with the 99.7% of the same accuracy as the 91-part ADI-R examination. Not only
            can artificial intelligence streamline the process, but an entirely artificially intelligent diagnosis
            system could potentially have a greater reach in clients and cater better to their needs. In fact, initial
            studies show that patients would be more comfortable with disclosing information to virtual humans rather
            than medical staff because virtual humans are able to spend more time with patients, are always friendly,
            and do not make the patient feel rushed.</p>
