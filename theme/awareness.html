        <p>There are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially
            conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by Bernard Baars and
            others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and
            Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control,
            Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function,
            Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor
            Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness and these are: The Brain
            is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and
            Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning
            Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects
            of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. </p>

        <p>The ability to predict foreseeable events is considered important for AC (AI Consciousness). The emergentist
            multiple drafts principle proposed by Daniel Dennett in Consciousness
            Explained may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate
            "draft" to fit the current environment. Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own
            proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.

            Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism
            enabling the organism to predict events. An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate
            events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to
            avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components
            that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and
            predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the
            present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent
            predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for
            novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real
            world. </p>
