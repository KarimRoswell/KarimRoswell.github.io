        <p>"Robot rights" is the concept that people should have moral obligations towards their machines, similar to
            human rights or animal rights. It has been suggested that robot rights, such as a right to exist and
            perform its own mission, could be linked to robot duty to serve human, by analogy with linking human rights
            to human duties before society. These could include the right to life and liberty, freedom of thought
            and expression and equality before the law.</p>

        <p>Robot ethics, sometimes known by the short expression "roboethics", concerns ethical problems that occur
            with robots, such as whether robots pose a threat to humans in the long or short run, whether some uses of
            robots are problematic (such as in healthcare or as 'killer robots' in war), and how robots should be
            designed such as they act 'ethically'. Robot ethics is a
            sub-field of ethics of technology, specifically information technology, and it has close links to legal as
            well as socio-economic concerns. Researchers from diverse areas are beginning to tackle ethical questions
            about creating robotic technology and implementing it in societies, in a way that will still ensure the
            safety of the human race.</p>
