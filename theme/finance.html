        <p>Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside
            of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987
            when Security Pacific National Bank in US set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorised
            use of debit cards. Programs like Kasisto and Moneystream are using AI in financial services.

            Banks use artificial intelligence systems today to organize operations, maintain book-keeping, invest in
            stocks, and manage properties. AI can react to changes overnight or when business is not taking place.
            In August 2001, robots beat humans in a simulated financial trading competition. AI has also reduced
            fraud and financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns of users for any abnormal changes or
            anomalies.

            The use of AI machines in the market in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed
            major economic theories. For example, AI based buying and selling platforms have changed the law of
            supply and demand in that it is now possible to easily estimate individualized demand and supply curves and
            thus individualized pricing. Furthermore, AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and thus
            making markets more efficient while reducing the volume of trades. Furthermore, AI in the markets limits
            the consequences of behavior in the markets again making markets more efficient. Other theories where AI
            has had impact include in rational choice, rational expectations, game theory, Lewis turning point,
            portfolio optimization and counterfactual thinking. </p>
