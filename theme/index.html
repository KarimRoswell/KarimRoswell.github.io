        <p>Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence
            displayed by humans and other animals. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in
            1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by the loss of funding
            which was then swiftly followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of AI's history,
            research has been divided into subcategories that often fail to
            communicate with each other. These subcategories are based on technical considerations, such as particular
            goals like robotics, the use of particular tools like logic or artificial
            neural networks, or deep philosophical differences.</p>



        <p>The field was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can
            be made to simulate it. This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the mind and the
            ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence which are issues that have been
            explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Some people also consider AI to be a danger
            to humanity if it progresses unabated. Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological
            revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.</p>

        <p>A typical AI perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving
            its goals. An AI's intended goal function can be simple or complex . Goals can
            be explicitly defined, or can be induced. If the AI is programmed for "reinforcement learning", goals can
            be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior and punishing others. Alternatively, an
            evolutionary system can create goals by using a "fitness function" to mutate and replicate
            high-scoring AI systems; this is similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as
            finding food, or how dogs can be bred via artificial selection to possess desired traits. Some AI
            systems, such as nearest-neighbor, instead reason by analogy; these systems are not generally given goals,
            except to the degree that goals are somehow implicit in their training data. Such systems can still be
            benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose "goal" is to successfully accomplish its
            narrow classification task.</p>
